        <p>So</p>
        <p>So you think you can tell</p>
        <p>Heaven from hell</p>
        <p>Blue skies from pain</p>
        <p>Can you tell a green field</p>
        <p>From a cold steel rail</p>
        <p>A smile from a veil</p>
        <p>Do you think you can tell</p>
        <p>And did they get you to trade</p>
        <p>Your heroes for ghosts</p>
        <p>Hot ashes for trees</p>
        <p>Hot air for a cool breeze</p>
        <p>Cold comfort for change</p>
        <p>And did you exchange</p>
        <p>A walk on part in the war</p>
        <p>For a lead role in a cage</p>
        <p>How I wish</p>
        <p>how I wish you were here</p>
        <p>We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl</p>
        <p>year after year</p>
        <p>Running over the same old ground</p>
        <p>What have you found</p>
        <p>The same old fears</p>
        <p>Wish you were here</p>
